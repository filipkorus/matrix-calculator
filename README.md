### About
There is a matrix class implemented in C++ with simple user interface to test code. The class itself consists of matrix operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, scalar multiplication, exponentiation and swapping rows/columns. Almost every of above is implemented using operator overloading. You can also do something like `std::cout << myMatrix << '\n';` due to output stream overload.
